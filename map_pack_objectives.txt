MAP_PACK_OBJECTIVES

Each map should have a theme that is sufficently distict from other maps. (Though there can be some overlap.)
Each map should have its theme and objectives described in the begining of its generator
Be useable in inland, costal and island form, unless a special objective is otherwise intented (ie, River & Volcano)
Be usable in and balanced for 30x30, and still be resonably playable in 20x20 & 40x40
Have as rich of a terrain variety as possible in executing the theme of the map
Maps are primarly for playing player vs computer, and a subset is for use in Random Campaign
Code should be as simple as possible, because I am dealing with a lot of maps.

Usability clause means mountains/impassable mountains/cave/cave wall should be the heighest terrain, and shallow & deep water the lowest in normal usage.
Useability clause means no bridges over deep water to prevent roads over deep water on costal & island maps
Likely means that deep water should not be frozen on winter maps
What is in beween is up to each individual map
This height range should transfer to most maps with no tweaks other than terrain type.
Villages should be able to appear on all possible terrains except for deep water, costal reef, unwalkable, & impassable
Should roads go through impassable if I have a low enough amount of impassible?


Standard height range
{HEIGHT 900 Mm^Xm}
{HEIGHT 600 Mm} # adjust as needed
{HEIGHT 450 Hh} # adjust as needed
{HEIGHT 100 Gg} # adjust as needed
{HEIGHT 050 Wwf} # adjust as needed, up not down
{HEIGHT 005 Ww}
{HEIGHT 000 Wo}
